Report: Data Preparation for Authentic vs. Synthetic Voice Detection
Objective:
The goal of this project is to engineer a model capable of accurately distinguishing between authentic
and synthetic human voices using a database containing recordings from 100 distinct speakers. The
model's performance must meet industrial standards for potential market deployment.
Challenges:
Imbalanced Dataset: The dataset exhibits an imbalance in samples between authentic and synthetic
voices, which may bias model training and evaluation. Addressing this class imbalance is crucial for
ensuring model generalization and performance.
Diverse Acoustic Conditions: The recordings encompass diverse acoustic conditions, including
variations in recording environments, equipment, and background noise levels. The model needs to be
robust to these variations to maintain accuracy across different scenarios.
Data Preprocessing Instructions:
Data Augmentation: Augment the dataset to address class imbalance by generating synthetic samples
for the minority class (authentic or synthetic) using techniques such as pitch shifting, time stretching,
and adding background noise. Ensure that the augmented data preserves the characteristics of the
original recordings.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant acoustic features from the audio recordings, such as Mel-
frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, or other time-frequency representations.

Experiment with different feature sets to capture unique characteristics of authentic and synthetic
voices.
Normalization: Normalize the extracted features to mitigate the effects of varying recording
conditions and ensure consistency across different recordings. Standardize the feature distributions to
have zero mean and unit variance.
Dimensionality Reduction: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), to reduce the
dimensionality of the feature space while preserving relevant information. This can help improve
model training efficiency and generalization.
Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets while ensuring that each
set maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Use stratified sampling to preserve
class balance across different sets.
Model Training Guidelines:
Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning models, such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or ensemble methods, to identify the most
suitable architecture for voice detection. Consider architectures known for their performance in audio
classification tasks.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Conduct thorough hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search
or random search to optimize model performance. Pay attention to parameters related to
regularization, learning rate, batch size, and network architecture.

Cross-Validation: Employ cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to evaluate
model performance robustly and ensure generalization to unseen data. Monitor metrics like accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
Regularization: Implement regularization techniques, such as dropout or L2 regularization, to prevent
overfitting and improve model generalization. Experiment with different regularization strengths to
find the optimal balance between bias and variance.
Conclusion:
By following these instructions for data preparation and model training, we aim to develop a robust
and accurate voice detection model capable of distinguishing between authentic and synthetic voices.
Continuously evaluate model performance and iterate on the data preprocessing and model
architecture to achieve the desired industrial standards for market deployment.
